turnkey-drupal9-16.1 (1) turnkey; urgency=low

  * Update Drupal9 to latest upstream version - 9.1.4.

  * Update Drush to latest - 10.3.6.

  * Drupal 9 files & directories all owned by 'www-data' user to make
    management easier. Note that whilst this does make management easier,
    (especially in conjunction with 'turnkey-composer') it does have
    security implications. To lock things down, you could change ownership.

  * Include 'turnkey-composer' wrapper script - runs composer as www-data
    user. Makes it easy to not run composer as root - part of #1539.

  * Explicitly install composer (rather than automatically include in all LAMP
    based appliances) - part of #1563.

  * Note: Please refer to turnkey-core's 16.1 changelog for changes common to
    all appliances. Here we only describe changes specific to this appliance.
